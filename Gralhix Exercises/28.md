## Process

#### Let's get started

Well a reverse image search doesn't get us very far. A lot of Netherlands, but hard to get an exact match. 

It's interesting that Sofia chose to say that she took the photo. Maybe we can get some info from her social media. The EXIF data on the photo is right in the HTML, we can right-click and Inspect to check it out. It gives us a timestamp of `2023-09-20 08:11:57`, and the camera, SM-A125F. A quick Google search tells us that this is the onboard camera of the Samsung Galaxy A12. Perfect!

 Looking at her social media, she seems to crosspost on multiple platforms at once, so let's just pick one. The until operator on Twitter can get us to the right time period. Let's put it a few days ahead so we can get a good look at the timeline surrounding the photo. 

`@gralhix until:2023-09-30`  gets us a tweet from 4 days after our timestamp

Well, we might as well take a look at this conference -- maybe it was her aforementioned destination. One of the photos has a presentation labeled **EUROPOL, The Hague, The Netherlands**; let's find their headquarters. A quick Google search tells us the address: **Eisenhowerlaan 73** in the Hague. Surely we can hop into Street View and start scanning, but let's see if we can expedite the process with [the Bellingcat OpenStreetMap search tool](https://osm-search.bellingcat.com/). Using the query `addr:housenumber = 55` and zooming in to the EUROPOL headquarters, we can quickly find some candidates.

Looks like the Bellingcat tool was a little overkill, because just down the street on Eisenhowerlaan is our spot!

If we pop both Eisenhowerlaan 73 and Eisenhowerlaan 55 into Google Maps, we get a distance of 68m.

## Solution

a) Samsung Galaxy A12 (SM-A125F)
b) EUROPOL headquarters, Eisenhowerlaan 73, 2517 KK Den Haag, Netherlands
c) 68m
