# Exercise 20

## Link
No link????

## Summary of problem

We have to actually find the Challenge...?!

## Process

#### Let's get started
Alright, there's no link. Challenge 19's URL is `https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/osint-exercise-019`, so we can try changing 19 to 20.

Well, something happened at least; we're left with this:

The phrase "I swear it was here a second ago is interesting." Let's check the page a second ago. [Pop the link into the Wayback Machine, click the earliest date](https://web.archive.org/web/20230828083935/https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/osint-exercise-020/) and.... got it! 

#### Our new briefing

Task briefing:
The internet is a digital ecosystem in constant transformation. Websites change appearance, domains change owners, businesses open and close, and accounts are created and deleted.
In July 2023, x.com went from being an almost blank page to redirecting to twitter.com.
Your task is to go back in time, until the year 2000, and find the following information within the x.com website:

b) The Frequently Asked Questions page.
c) The list of members of the management team in July.


#### Back in time

Alright, well let's pop x.com into the Wayback Machine and check the Year 2000. We need to eventually do July, so let's try that.

Hm. Unfortunately the link to the FAQ page at the bottom doesn't work very well at all. The link was `https://secure.x.com/help_faq.asp`. 

Going to the URLs section of the Wayback Machine, we can search for all URLs starting with `x.com/help`. And we get a result from 2000! Turns out, we needed to change the extension to `.htm` to [access the FAQs](https://web.archive.org/web/20000618112127/http://x.com:80/help_faq.htm).

Now that we have that taken care of, let's see if we can find the managers in July. Maybe it's on an "About Us" page? Let's throw `x.com/about` into the URLs search.

Even better! One of the results, from 2000 is called `about_management.htm`.  Lets [grab a snapshot from July](https://web.archive.org/web/20000706205553/http://x.com:80/about_management.htm) to finish the challenge.
