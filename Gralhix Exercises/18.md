## Summary of problem

In May 2023, the world witnessed the coronation of King Charles III at Westminster Abbey in London. Following the ceremony, and similarly to the previous regent, the monarch travelled through the city in a lavish carriage. The route of the 2023 royal procession differed from that of 1953. 

a) Identify from which exact door Queen Elizabeth II left Westminster Abbey after her coronation.
b) Measure the distance travelled by the Queen’s carriage, following the 1953 coronation.
c) Estimate the average speed at which the Queen’s carriage travelled.

 

## Process

#### Let's get started

Well let's see if there's video coverage! There sure is.
After scanning through some of the videos, a few things are clear:

First of all, the queen seems to have entered through a temporary structure in the front of the church. The announcer refers to it as the "Annex" [in this video](https://youtu.be/LEDp34MRI20?t=246)

The queen's carriage can be seen pulling up to the annex entrance:

The annex was situated at the front/main door of Westminster Abbey (on the west side), as can be seen from these photos -- the annex being in variously constructed states:

#### The queen's exit
As the queen marches out of the Abbey, [this video shows her leaving through the annex](https://youtu.be/VtL4THlDzHo?t=329). Therefore, it stands to be reasoned that she departed through the same main/west door as she entered.

#### The queen's procession
The National Archives has [a map that document's the queen's official route throughout London](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/significant-events/coronation-of-elizabeth-ii-1953/), seen here.

![queen's route](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PC-22_11_1953-Eliz-II-coronation-map.jpg)

This map shows a rout starting at Buckingham Palace and arriving at Westminster Abbey, but the prompt is only concerned with the second trip, from the Abbey, around London and back to the Palace.

Using the Google Maps "Measure Distance" tool, we get a distance that is a hair over 5 miles.

The table at the bottom of the official route map estimates that the Queen's coach would depart Westminster Abbey at 2:50 and arrive at Buckingham Palace at 4:30. A 5.04 mile journey in ~100 minutes comes out to about 3.024 miles per hour. Quite slow!



#### A nice epilogue
In fact, it seems that [the queen did not remember the slow ride fondly, and correctly estimates a journey of about 4-5 miles!](https://youtu.be/OTsA5hBTNDY?t=22)





## Solution

a) West/front/main door
b) 5.04
c) 3.024 miles per hour


#### Time Estimate
45 mins
