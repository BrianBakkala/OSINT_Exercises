## Summary of problem

a) Locate the building.
b) Find the quote containing the word “anarchy”.


## Observations/Deductions

- Even if the building is located, how are we going to get photos of inside?
    - Surely there's no Street View
    - Hopefully this wall is well-photographed!

## Process

#### Let's get started

Well most of our hopes are riding on Google Lens here.

One of the results was this photo from a blog:

The pillar looks really close to our original photo. The blog post is called [Exploring Sykes Datatronics by The Colorblind Photographer](https://www.colorblindedphoto.com/blog/2009/10/11/exploring-sykes-datatronics) and details a walkthrough of the old offices of a failed electronics company in Rochester, NY.

And we have lift off: a photo of our wall is a breeze to find.

There are a few other photos but nothing about anarchy: why would it be so simple?!
The location is found [ on the Urban Exploration Resource website](https://www.uer.ca/locations/show.asp?locid=24222), where it says "Status: Demolished".

Easy enough to find on Maps:

and to confirm that there was once a building there using Old Street View coverage.

#### The other quote

A quick Google Search for **Sykes Datatronics** brings up a [Flickr album by Alex Luyckx](https://www.flickr.com/photos/axle81401/albums/72157621958651052/), and just a few rows down, [we find our quote](https://www.flickr.com/photos/axle81401/albums/72157621958651052/)

## Solution

a) 43.16368137725061, -77.6355554033548
b) "This office was a prison for our brothers and sisters in wage slavery. Let's make it a carnival for our brothers and sisters in anarchy."
