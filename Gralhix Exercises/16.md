## Process

#### Let's get started

Googling each aircraft produces a Wikipedia section of USAF operators of the two aircraft. This is definitely information that we can cross-reference and filter by those units who operated the aircraft in 2020.

Some reverse image searching yields a more accurate datestamp from the horse's mouth: defense.gov. On the site, [this article](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/1280750/oir-official-outlines-gains-pays-tribute-to-fallen-soldiers/) uses the photo and the photo's description gives the date May 31, 2017. It also mentions *Operation Inherent Resolve*.

On [the photographer's bio on DVIDS, the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service](https://www.dvidshub.net/portfolio/1094284/michael-battles), it confirms that he was in Operation Resolve in 2017. We can also [filter his photos to show those from around the timestamp](https://www.dvidshub.net/search/?q=&filter%5Bmember_id_credit%5D=1094284&view=grid&filter[date]=20170521-20170607).

[There is our original photo](https://www.dvidshub.net/image/3441685/kc-10s-fueling-oir-fight)! We get a little more landscape in this uncropped version.

We also have a few more photos from the same series, which give us much more info about the terrain!

Just a two days before, the photographer wrote an [article about Qayyarah West Airfield in Iraq](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/235608/1st-eceg-restores-q-west-airfield-support-oir-operations).

Lets hop into Google Earth in Iraq and pause time in 2017.
A quick match! Hadithah Dam Lake in Iraq.

A little farther away: the Atatürk Dam Lake in Türkiye!

This gives us a general search area to work with. 
![Search area](https://i.imgur.com/LGSp1qF.png)
Naturally, our two main search areas are going the be the Tigris and the Euphrates. The Hadithah Dam and Atatürk Dam are both on the Euphrates, so let's start there. The character of the Euphrates changes along its course. Up north by the Atatürk Dam, the river is deep and wide. There are very few river islands.

Farther south, in Iraq, we see the Euphrates splitting in a way much more characteristic of the photo

No luck. No luck on the Tigris either.
The only river around the Hadithat Dam Lake site is the Euphrates. Let's try around the Atatürk site.

The valley landscape/terrain here feels much closer.

Aha! Near the Ataturk Dam off of one of the Euphrates' branches, the Göksu River is this:
