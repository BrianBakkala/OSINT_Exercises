## Process

#### Let's get started


Google Lens on Image 1 returns quite a few results. A few though are in Colombia and reference a group called the ELN. [This article](https://colombiapeace.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/open-letter-to-the-eln/) features a photo that gets us a pretty good look at the ELN logo.

Spot on! Looks like Ejército de Liberación Nacional (National Liberation Army) for photo 1.

#### Photo 2

Surely the hint is the star logo on the gun. Google Lens yields a link to a "PKK flag" and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). A [quick look on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers%27_Party) yields a strong match in aesthetic

and the PKK flag is a dead ringer for the gun decal

Unfortunately, the uniforms don't match very well, and it's probably worth digging a little deeper.
There are is a noticeable majority of women in many of the pictures, and Wikipedia says there there is actually a dedicated unit of women called the YJA-STAR.

[An article interviewing a member of the YJA-STAR](https://anfenglishmobile.com/rojava-syria/yja-star-guerrilla-Serda-azadi-2024-will-be-the-year-of-victory-71063) gives us a great look at a very similar uniform to the one the person in photo #2 is wearing.

The "grid" pattern over the camo, the rolled up cuffs, and the camo/sleeve/protector on the gun are all very strong matches.

The indications are strong that the person in photo 2 is a member of PKK and likely of the division YJA-STAR


#### Photo 3 
This might be the toughest to match. There is a small black and white flag in the back that is going to be tricky to identify, but will strongly confirm a match if one is found.

A few dead ends, but finally, a scan down the Wikipedia page [List of active rebel groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_rebel_groups), and our flag appears. It's a really solid match!

![jaish](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Flag_of_Jaish_al-Adl.svg/800px-Flag_of_Jaish_al-Adl.svg.png)

It's the flag of *Jaish ul-Adl*, a Sunni Jihadist separatist group based in Iran.

And we can find [an article about Jaish ul-Adl](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/01/18/718452/What-is-%E2%80%98Jaish-al-Adl%E2%80%99-and-what-makes-it-a-dreaded-terrorist-group-) that has a photo with a striking resemblance to photo 3

Looks like that's everything!


## Solution

1) Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN)
2) Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Probably YJA-STAR division
3) Jaish ul-Adl

#### Time Estimate
30-40 mins
