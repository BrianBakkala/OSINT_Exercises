a) What is the name of the resort?
b) What are the coordinates of the island?
c) In which cardinal direction was the camera facing when the photo was taken?


## Relevant Information
Resort

## Observations/Deductions
- First thought is Hawaii/Polynesia
- "resort" helps. This island is not very remote/uninhabited/etc.

## Process

#### Let's get started
Gotta start with Google reverse image search here. A few similar ones come up, but one called [Oan Resort](https://oanresort.wixsite.com/chuuk/about) is spot-on. "Resort"! This one should be wrapped up quickly.

The website *conveniently* has a video of Google Earth that shows exactly where the resort is. It also has the Google Maps location embedded [on the contact page](https://oanresort.wixsite.com/chuuk/contact).

#### To Google Earth!
Easy enough to line up Google Earth to the photo and find out that we are facing approximately west.

a) Oan Resort
b) 7.363378571737105, 151.75601291615428
c) West

#### Time Estimate
5-10 mins
