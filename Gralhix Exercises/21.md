## Summary of problem

Geolocate a Chocolate Bar! ... also a screenshot

## Relevant Information

- "do it right" logo on chocolate


## Observations/Deductions
- the map is going to make it very easy to confirm, but not necessarily to find.

## Process

#### Let's get started
We can start by Googling **do it right chocolate**. Looks lke our chocolate is going to be made by Puchero, according to [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jun/05/notes-on-chocolate-bonkers-bars-that-hit-the-spot). It even has a picture of the map chocolate bar!

It actually looks like the exact right mak, rotated one quarter turn clockwise. Tough to say for sure. Let's try the flavor to see. Throw **Puchero Chocolate con Mantequilla** into Google, [and we have our chocolate](https://somospuchero.com/producto/butter-55-chocolate-con-mantequilla/). But looking at a [few other choices on their menu](https://somospuchero.com/categoria-producto/chocolate/), it seems that quite a few of them have the same design.

...Is it just where this company is located? Their address is at the bottom of their website.
