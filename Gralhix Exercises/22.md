## Relevant Information

-Yamoto Fishing Port
-Timestamp says JST


## Observations/Deductions
- Surely JST + Yamoto = Japan
- Street View usually blurs license plates
    - potentially a problem
- the jetties/"bars" in the port are probably unique/distinct

## Process

#### Let's get started
Google lens gives us the livestream right away! http://202.239.224.34/control/userimage.html

##### Geolocating the camera
Google can't believe that we don't want "yam**A**to". Going directly to maps, centering on Japan and then typing Yamoto gets us [Yamoto train station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yamoto+Station/@38.4120388,141.2131128,6919m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x5f89a26eed8ed719:0x1dc512b202db003c!8m2!3d38.4205514!4d141.2092163!16zL20vMGN2bGZs?entry=ttu) in northeast Honshu.

Just nearby the station is a small port and ... the barriers are unmistakable!

It looks like we're dealing with the southernmost section there. Let's check out Street View.

Hi livestream!

#### The trucks

Turning around...

There's our truck! This looks like the more recent one, from the 2023 livestream. But as we feared, the plates are too blurry.

Well, we can use Google Lens to find out more about the company with the Japanese text of its name: アイザワ水産 (Aizawa Fisheries). On their Facebook, they have [this photo of our truck](https://www.facebook.com/aizawasuisan/photos/pb.100054424002192.-2207520000/607440969405874/?type=3)!

The license plate is 31-20. This is the second truck (2023) and we need to find the truck with the older 2015 timestamp.


#### The other truck
On the company's YouTube channel, we get a good closeup of the truck in [this video](https://youtu.be/0DQxP8N9j40?t=935).

Frustratingly, we can't see the license plate!

On the company's website, they have a blog with a post called *[Specialty Seaweed making 2015](https://www.aizawasuisan.com/%E3%81%93%E3%81%A0%E3%82%8F%E3%82%8A%E3%81%AE%E6%B5%B7%E8%8B%94%E3%81%A5%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8A2018/%E3%81%93%E3%81%A0%E3%82%8F%E3%82%8A%E3%81%AE%E6%B5%B7%E8%8B%94%E3%81%A5%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8A2015/)*, our datestamp! Buried in a slideshow at the bottom is this picture:
