## Process

#### Let's get started
Surely we should start with a reverse image search. 

Google Lens didn't really work well at first. I tried TinEye to get some re-crops of the same image and then Google Lens again, and eventually ended up [on Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WaziriyaAutobombeIrak.jpg).

Regardless of the validity of the description, the timestamp well predates the tweet. There are many other sites and places that this image or variants of it are used, but at the end of the day: looks like we're done here.


## Solution
No integrity!


#### Time Estimate
5-10 mins
