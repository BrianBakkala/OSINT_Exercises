Your task is to find the answers to the following questions:
a) Where was the photo taken?
b) In which year was the photo taken?
c) The big poster on the right contained a link to a website. What was the link?

## Relevant Information
- from the prompt: a city
- statue
- Tutankhamon exhibit
- long promenade

## Observations/Deductions
- this statue is quite unusual and probably our best starting place
- Tutankamon non-standard spelling, almost certainly not English-speaking.

## Process

#### Let's get started

Let's fire up Google Lens. We should be able to isolate the statue.
Tons of hits right away in Lisbon. It's apparently called the **Homem-Sol** (Man-Sun) by Jorge Vieira.

#### Lisbon
Throwing **Homem-Sol Lisbon** into Google and hopping into Street View we can look back towards the statue from the other direction at the Vasco da Gama Shopping Center.

Looks like the photographer was up on the escalator. The handrail confirms it!

#### The Poster
Moving down the road a bit, we can use the "See more dates" feature to go back in time. Selecting coverage from October 2019 gets us the right poster.

A different angle might be clearer, but we can just make out the link on the bottom of the poster: www.tutankamon.pt.

## Solution

a) Centro Comercial Vasco da Gama, Lisbon, Portugal
b) 2019
c) www.tutankamon.pt

#### Time Estimate
10-15 mins
