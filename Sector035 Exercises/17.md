![geolocation](https://sector035.nl/quiz/beginners/content/16.jpg)
This statue can be found somewhere in the world and even has its own 'square'. Can you find out where this statue is and find the name of the 'square'?

## Process



#### Let's get started

We can start by popping this picture into Google Lens.

Searching for the statue isn't very successful, but we get a strong match for the fire truck in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/VQI6BbpYQ_M?t=11).

It looks like the license plate may be only one digit off!!!
`D US 2420`
`D US 2421`

Anyway, Googling `dusseldorf bronze statue` gets us the statue of former President of Germany Johannes Rau!
