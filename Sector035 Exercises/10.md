## Summary of problem

http://www.virtualradar.nl/virtualradar/desktop.html 

By looking at the traffic between your browser and the website, and looking at the JSON, can you deduct the name of the variable that shows the total amount of aeroplanes currently tracked within the view you've selected?

## Process

#### Let's get started

Let's check out this flight tracker website. On the right hand menu panel, it says **Tracking C aircraft out of Y** It's hard to tell if the prompt is asking for X or Y, but let's look for both.


The network tab continuously makes requests to "AircraftList.json" and in the response is a variable called `totalAc` which matches the Y value. Let's give that a shot!

## Solution

totalAc
