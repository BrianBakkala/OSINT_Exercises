## Summary of problem

For this question I'm going to feature the awesome Nico 'Dutch OSINT Guy' Dekens. We'll be looking at a YouTube video, and you will need to find some online tool to view additional information about the video. Can you tell me what the date and time of publishing is of the following video?

    }
}

```

Of course, the relevant line is ` "publishedAt": "2020-06-04T19:19:58Z"`

The desired format is `yyyymmddhhmmss`.
