## Summary of problem

Time to dive one last time into EXIF data with a fairly easy question. Open the following website and extract the EXIF information from the image of the typewriter. You might not be able to download this image right away, so maybe use the developer tools to find the direct URL to download it. Go have a look at the abundance of information inside the EXIF data:

#### Let's get started

We can use  [jimpl](https://jimpl.com/) to look at the EXIF. 

In the `LegacyIPTCDigest` field, we have the following value: `F5B9EFCFD52592DC2821842599A3416F`

## Solution
