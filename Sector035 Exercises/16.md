## Summary of problem

Using the website Elephind, you'll be searching for articles about open source intelligence.

Find a newspaper from October 29, 2007. The term is mentioned in a calendar of some kind. Find the calendar item in question, and look for the name of the person that is mentioned. What is his name?

## Process

#### Let's get started
Turns out that Elephind has been taken offline. Hm.

Well, we can put it in the Wayback Machine and use the ["Browse the newspaper archives" link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126052123/https://elephind.com/?a=p&p=browsepubs&e=-------en-10--1--txt-txINtxCO----------). From there, we can check each "source website" link that has newspapers which contain articles in 2007. In each one, we can use the query `"open source intelligence"` and see if we get any hits.

Finally! [The Stanford Daily Archives](https://archives.stanforddaily.com/search?article_text=%22open%20source%20intelligence%22) has an article, and it's from October 2007!

On the calendar we find:

And we're done!
