## Summary of problem

For a Quiztime geolocation challenge Fiete Stegers tweeted a photo from his new workplace a few years ago. Nowadays, a lot of social media remove most metadata of images or videos. But when you download media files from a website, it sometimes pays off to check whether the metadata, or EXIF information, of a file is still there. With the photo I give you here, it should be possible to find out what the location of the building is.

To answer the question: Don't bother geolocating the building itself, that would be too easy! I want you to find the GPS coordinates in the file itself. Make sure to retrieve it, or convert it to the following decimal format:

yy.yyyy,xx.xxxx (that is: latitude,longitude)

Note: Make sure to cut off the coordinates at 4 numbers after the decimal!

## Process

#### Let's get started

We can use [jimpl](https://jimpl.com/) to look at the EXIF. 

Pasting the link in, we get 

53°33'23.9"N 10°01'19.5"E.

In the correct format, we get 53.5566,10.0220

## Solution
53.5566,10.0220
