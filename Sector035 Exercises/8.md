## Summary of problem

in February 2019 Reddit user 'Webbreacher' shared the playlist of the 10-minute tips over on Reddit. Find this message, and extract the Unix 'timestamp' of this post.  

#### Let's get started

Reddit search query `minute author:webbreacher` and we are in business. Right-click, inspect, and we have a time element to work with: `<time title="Wed Feb 20 21:24:45 2019 UTC" datetime="2019-02-20T21:24:45+00:00">5 years ago</time>`. Finally, we can use [this site](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) to generate our timestamp in milliseconds.


## Solution
1550697885000

#### Time Estimate
5 mins
