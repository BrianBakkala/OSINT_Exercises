## Summary of problem
In September 2019 someone posted in an aviation forum a quote that explained how **@trbrtc** was using shadows, that were cast by towers around a launch pad, as sun dials. But what is the username of the account that posted this?

## Relevant Information
- The Twitter account is linked
    - This is probably how the user "identified" him in the forum post.

## Observations/Deductions
- "sun dials"
- "launch pads"
    - strange that those are two words, and not compound words
## Process

#### Let's get started
We can Google `@trbrtc "launch pad" "sun dials"` to find [the forum post](https://www.airliners.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1430561). It's dated September 3, 2019. Perfect! 

The username is **Tugger**.


## Solution

Tugger
