a) In which zoo are these polar bears located?
b) What was the temperature at the time of the screenshot?
c) What were the exact coordinates of where the bears were lying down?

## Relevant Information
Polar bears
Not much else!
January

## Observations/Deductions
It looks like flowers are blooming in January. Maybe southern hemisphere?

## Process

#### Let's get started
Alright let's try our luck on a reverse image search.

Not super helpful. Just some sleeping polar bears.

Googling **polar bear live stream** yields a [Polar Cam from the San Diego Zoo](https://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/cams/polar-cam). San Diego could certainly look flowery in January. Unfortunately the view doesn't look the same.

On second thought, this "Pride Rock" structure looks pretty similar to the one from the photo! It's close, but not quite right. Maybe the camera used to be at a different angle? 
Some clicking around the San Diego Zoo Youtube page produces livestream VODs, specifically [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpsQzkGobTA). It looks like the same structure as the current livestream but from an ever-so-slightly different angle.  Skipping through the video, it turns out that the camera has some rudimentary motion tracking. When it's at the right angle, sure enough, [there's our scene](https://youtu.be/CpsQzkGobTA?t=6290) in the top right corner!

#### Part B, Weather
A quick [historical weather check from Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ca/san-diego/KSAN/date/2023-1-15) says it was 63°F in San Diego at around 2pm.



#### Part C, Coordinates
After taking a look at[ a zoo map](https://sandiegozoowildlifealliance.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/05-24-24_SDZ24-Map-Front_web.pdf) to get a more precise location, we can hop into Google Earth to find the "peninsula" that the bears are lying on.

There is Street View coverage, but the exhibit looks a little different in 2009.
