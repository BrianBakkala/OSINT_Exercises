## Process

#### Let's get started
Google Lens to get it rolling. [These tweets](https://twitter.com/Michael45231497/status/1753707111828062252) lead us to NASA [FIRMS, the Fire Information for Resource Management System](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/). The menu is a dead match; on to the next part.

#### Where?

Looks like there's a river there. The scale at the bottom gives a general sense of how far to zoom in. The region is clearly quite mountainous right up to this western coastline. The Andes are a good first choice, and a quick scan for that smooth/flat region in the bottom left yielded Chile, a bit south-southwest of Santiago. At the mouth of the river is the city [Constituci√≥n](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Constituci%C3%B3n,+Constitucion,+Maule,+Chile/@-35.5580239,-72.7421976,9.46z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x96665f4687ed19f5:0x18b1075e8c2e2b21!8m2!3d-35.3306433!4d-72.4103962!16zL20vMGRjMDk0?entry=ttu).

#### When?

Let's go backwards year by year, and check January 31 (as per the prompt) and set the range to 31 days before. 2017 lit up like a Christmas tree! By checking each day one at a time, we can find [the 26th](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#d:2017-01-26;l:fires_all,countries,country-outline,earth;@-72.63,-35.68,9.43z) pretty quickly!

## Solution

a) [NASA FIRMS](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/)
b) Chile
c) January 26th, 2017
