#### Let's get started

Searching Twitter for "Thank u for interested" easily finds the tweet.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank u for interested in Indonesian culture<br><br>In the same regard I also fascinated how African voodoo &amp; mysticism still alive nowadays in form of voodoo festival &amp; dances. (My favorite is these zangbeto dolls) itâ€™s beautiful how people still connected to their ancestral roots ðŸ˜ƒ <a href="https://t.co/Y8H1llx96Z">pic.twitter.com/Y8H1llx96Z</a></p>&mdash; Shandya (@shandya) <a href="https://twitter.com/shandya/status/1613454460738768897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


#### Check the photos!


Success! The photo in the top right is from [Adventurous Gina's blog](https://adventurousgina.com/travel/f/a-trip-down-memory-lane--benin%E2%80%99s-voodoo-dancers)

Another hit! The last photo, the one of the two isolated figures [was used as early as 2012](https://www.nydailynews.com/2012/06/14/voodoo-chic-style-parade-at-witchcraft-festival/) and has a citation for Dan Kitwood.


The first photo is a little trickier. Google Lens doesn't give much. TinEye referenced a Dan Kitwood blog, but the links to the pictures were broken! Luckily, [the Wayback Machine saved the day](https://web.archive.org/web/20120924030627/http://www.dankitwood.com:80/2012/06/15/voodoo/). The first picture was indeed taken by Dan Kitwood in Ouidah, Benin!

#### Previous City
The same blog has [a previous entry called "Getting my bearings in Benin"](https://web.archive.org/web/20120621075421/http://www.dankitwood.com/2012/01/27/getting-ones-bearings-in-benin/) in which he mentions his previous destinations. Before Ouidah, Dan mentions going to a fishing *village* called Ganvie, and before that, a *city* called Cotonou. Since the prompt specifically asks for city, probably the answer is Cotonou, which is just about 25 miles from Ouidah.
  
## Solution
a) a Voodoo Fesitval
b) Left and bottom right (#1 and #3)
c) Cotonou

#### Time Estimate
30-40 mins
