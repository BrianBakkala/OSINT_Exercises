## Process

#### Let's get started
We can go for a Google: **president of turkey residence**. Google returns the "Turkish presidential complex"
This sounds great! Let's take a look. 

#### Turkish Presidential Complex
No luck on street view or Google Earth 3D buildings. Wikipedia shows this building:

Those doors look great! It lists the main building as the **Cumhurbaşkanlığı Sarayı** or Presidential Palace. A quick Google yields [this article](https://www.birgun.net/haber/israil-cumhurbaskani-herzog-cumhurbaskanligi-sarayi-nda-resmi-torenle-karsilandi-379894) with an almost identical photo!

The headline of the article specifically mentions the **Cumhurbaşkanlığı Sarayı**!

The big courtyard from the Wikipedia photo can only be here!
