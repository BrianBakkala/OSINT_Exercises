## Process

### Let's get started

Well, let's Google **Flinders Street Station**. Google gives Flinders Street in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

### Street View
A quick Street View check confirms that the building in the background does indeed say IBM!

And we have our answer to part A, *Flinders Street Station*. Not too surprising, honestly!

### Google Earth
The Google Earth 3D Buildings feature makes [finding the IBM building](https://earth.google.com/web/search/-37.8186887,144.9634482/@-37.82091028,144.96657734,84.13864953a,356.07699541d,35y,166.94449345h,86.43218858t,360r/data=CigiJgokCdLrLmNvoTBAEWmxmYy6ljBAGalIIdh7uibAIWaGhNCs2ibAOgMKATA) a breeze:

### Finding the height
And a little bit of a long shot, but let's Google **60 City Road, Southbank, Victoria height**

![IBM Australia building info](https://i.imgur.com/VgQCqcK.png)
Works for me! Who knew that the [Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat would be so helpful](https://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/ibm-australia/13493)? It seems that both towers are connected, and that the address spans 40-60 City Road. This explains the small discrepancy in the address number.

Looks like we're done here!

### Solution
a) Flinders Street Station
b) 131m / 430ft
