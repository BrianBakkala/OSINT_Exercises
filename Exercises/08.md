## Process

#### Let's get started

Googling **dajiyuan wikipedia** gets us to the newspaper, [the Epoch Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Epoch_Times).

We could almost certainly reverse image search this picture, or translate the text with Google Lens, but let's see if we can ... not! A theater performance with Chinese news coverage could definitely be Shen Yun. Let's check the tour schedule for January 2023 in the UK! 

[Using the Wayback Machine, we can see that Shen Yun stopped in a few places before January 12th on its Europe tour](https://web.archive.org/web/20221205012513/https://www.shenyun.com/tickets?lang=en-us). The links to each show are dead now, but the URLs show the names of the venues. Unfortunately, none of these venues really match. Some are close, but none are quite right. Let's try the Asian and United States tours. 

Working backwards from January 12th, and after discouragingly striking out a few times: Chrysler Hall in Norfolk Virginia! The two balconies, the ridges on the side walls, a perfect match.

#### Chrysler Hall
Alright, then let's Google **"shen yun" "chrysler hall" "epoch times"**. After sifting through a few Epoch Times misses, we get [this article from a different newspaper](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2023/1/13/206159.html) which has our picture, and cites the Epoch Times and the show on January 7th! We'll take it.


## Solution

a) Shen Yun
b) January 7th, 2023
c) Chrysler Hall, Norfolk, Virginia

#### Time Estimate
30-40 mins
