## Process

#### Let's get started

Googling **telescope "university of bonn" 1953** gets us to [this page](https://web.astronomicalheritage.net/index.php/show-entity?identity=114&idsubentity=1) about the University of Bonn Observatory. It lists a telescope built in 1953 by Askania of Berlin, the *34/50-cm-Schmidt Telescope*. It even has a photo! ![Schmidt telescope](https://web.astronomicalheritage.net/images/astronomicalheritage.net/gallery/ahp_entities/entity000114/OHL_Turm-1_Schmidt-Spiegel_Christoph-Schmidt-P1130715.jpg)

Google also turns up this photo, dated January 1953 
![imago image in use](https://cdn.imago-images.com/bild/st/0061895213/m.jpg). 
This could certainly be a match!

If we Google **"Schmidt Telescope"  berlin**, we can also find photos of the assembly in Berlin ![Assembly](https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1363236773/photo/fabrication-dun-t%C3%A9l%C3%A9scope-%C3%A0-berlin.jpg?s=2048x2048&w=gi&k=20&c=e682D7Ga-yrMKWWbj-pGAqCJHLXd-p5tQ82DhetU7_E=)![Assembly2](https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1363236812/photo/fabrication-dun-t%C3%A9l%C3%A9scope-%C3%A0-berlin.jpg?s=2048x2048&w=gi&k=20&c=MNfp0fB3fsFWJ-zJZZ4iwHRy7pYvvnB3Tu8dLOD0tEQ=)


#### Its location
[The original listing we looked at]((https://web.astronomicalheritage.net/index.php/show-entity?identity=114&idsubentity=1)) said that it was at *Hoher List, Tower 1*

The Hoher List Observatory site has a helpful map to help us get our bearings. ![hoher list map](https://27c2878096.clvaw-cdnwnd.com/3df8ef63a966867dd28cd508e0a1dd3e/200001617-3aa4f3aa52/Kuppel_Namen_2_crop.webp?ph=27c2878096)

And we can easily find the coordinates of Tower 1!
