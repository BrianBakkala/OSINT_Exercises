- Eastern Europe/Soviet Cars and Architecture?

## Process

#### Let's get started
Let's check the database for a possible candidate earthquake. This website records the earthquake timestamps in UTC, so it's possible that it "leaked" into another UTC day, since it's at ~2am local time. [Let's check for earthquakes around that date of magnitudes 4 or more](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?extent=-87.303,126.21094&extent=87.28641,519.96094&range=search&sort=largest&timeZone=utc&search=%7B%22name%22:%22Search%20Results%22,%22params%22:%7B%22starttime%22:%222016-09-23%2000:00:00%22,%22endtime%22:%222016-09-25%2023:59:59%22,%22minmagnitude%22:4,%22orderby%22:%22time%22%7D%7D).




Sure enough, we have an [earthquake in Romania](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us10006s5c/executive). The timestamp is off by a few minutes, but let's give it a shot. It's the best hit in line with the Eastern Europe hypothesis. There's another in Western Russia to check as well, but that seems less likely. 

Googling **Romania earthquake 9-24-2016** gets us this video. Success!

Interestingly though, the title says it's in Chișinău.
