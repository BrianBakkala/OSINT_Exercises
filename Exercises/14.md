a) What was the magnitude of this earthquake?
b) What are the coordinates of where the camera was likely located in order to record this scene?

## Relevant Information
- 2016-09-24

## Observations/Deductions

- Eastern Europe/Soviet Cars and Architecture?

## Process

#### Let's get started
Let's check the database for a possible candidate earthquake. This website records the earthquake timestamps in UTC, so it's possible that it "leaked" into another UTC day, since it's at ~2am local time. [Let's check for earthquakes around that date of magnitudes 4 or more](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?extent=-87.303,126.21094&extent=87.28641,519.96094&range=search&sort=largest&timeZone=utc&search=%7B%22name%22:%22Search%20Results%22,%22params%22:%7B%22starttime%22:%222016-09-23%2000:00:00%22,%22endtime%22:%222016-09-25%2023:59:59%22,%22minmagnitude%22:4,%22orderby%22:%22time%22%7D%7D).




Sure enough, we have an [earthquake in Romania which had a magnitude of 5.6](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us10006s5c/executive). The timestamp is off by a few minutes, but let's give it a shot. It's the best hit in line with the Eastern Europe hypothesis. There's another in Western Russia to check as well, but that seems less likely. 

Googling **Romania earthquake 9-24-2016** gets us this video. Success!

Interestingly though, the title says it's in Chișinău -- certainly still within the realm of possibility. Alright, let's hop into Google Earth in Moldova. Only a few roads in Chișinău are so wide, with three lanes on each side. A couple hops into Street View and we can find this building:

Looks like the one in our background, albeit maybe from a different angle. From there, it's not too hard to find our high-rise apartment building and viewpoint.

We can even see the metal pyramid structure at the base of the big triangular building, which is clearly visible on the original video.
